            Graphite is a graphics engine designed over the module Graphics.py. <br>
            The purpose of Graphite is to speed up development of graphical apps. <br>
            But graphite is still in development. <br>
            But thankfully the development is currently speeding up. <br>
            The end goal of graphite is to give developers a module that has everything prefabricated 
            and give developers a better time developing their apps. <br>
